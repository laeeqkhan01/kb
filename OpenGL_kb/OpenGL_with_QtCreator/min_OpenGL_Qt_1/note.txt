This example shows how to create an OpenGL widget inside
QtCreator.

Half the work will be done by hand, and half by 
Qt Designer.

A class derived from QOpenGLWidget needs to be created
We are calling this class OGL_1.
Create the class using "Add New C++ class" of Qt Creator.
Keep base class as QOpenGLWidget <Custom>
Type QOpenGLWidget under Base class:
Don't check any of the check boxes.
This will create two files, ogl_1.h and ogl_1.cpp.
#include <QOpenGLWidget> in header
Make constructor take argument (QWidget *parent = 0)
Complete the class by creating follwing methods

protected:
    void initializeGL();
    void resizeGL(int w, int h);
    void paintGL();

In Designer mainwindow.ui form,
drag a "Widget" to the mainwindow.ui form

Right click on Widget/QWidget and choose "Promote to"
In the "Promoted class name "OGL_1" the class you 
created by hand earlier.

Click "Add"
Click "Promote"

"Promote" it to new class "OGL_1"
